        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate developer who loves to create innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
        <p2>I believe coding isn't just about writing lines on a screen; it's about making things better. 
            Whether it's designing websites or building apps, 
            I dive into each project with excitement and a desire to make it great. 
            My portfolio shows the different projects I've worked on, each one a story of how I've used my 
            skills to make something useful and cool.
